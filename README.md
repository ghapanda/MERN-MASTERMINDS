# Project for CS35L. Website for Offbeat Sessions.

Our web application is a dance club portal in which club members can view upcoming club events, detailed profile information about their fellow club members, and enjoy a sense of community with their fellow dancers.

## Key Features

1) User accounts with the ability to sign up, log in, differentiate between members and admins, and attach customizable data to show off on a user's profile page.
2) A stylish landing page with links for more information about the club, to create a new account, and to log in with an existing account.
3) A dynamic schedule page in which admins can create events that everyone can see
4) A dynamic schedule page in which general members can view events and add/remove themselves from an event to give a headcount of who is coming.
6) A search function which allows users to look up another club member
7) Personalized dynamic profile pages which a user is allowed to customize as they see fit, allowing them to include images, short videos of them dancing, as well as a text description.
8) A navigation bar which redirects to various pages in the web application
